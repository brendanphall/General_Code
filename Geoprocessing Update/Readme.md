Data Review

This script analyzes a given input directory or ZIP archive containing geospatial data, particularly shapefiles, and generates an XML report summarizing the contents. It extracts file hierarchy information, validates shapefile components, and collects geospatial metadata, including coordinate reference system (CRS), bounding box, feature count, geometry types, attributes, and sample data.

/Solution /Conversion_Script_complete.py

This script processes geospatial data by extracting and converting shapefiles into ArcGIS JSON format while reprojecting geometries to the Web Mercator (EPSG:3857) coordinate system. It supports both ZIP archives and directories as input, dynamically handling file extraction and filtering valid shapefiles. Using **Fiona** for reading geospatial data and **Shapely** for geometry validation, the script ensures geometries are correctly transformed and structured for ArcGIS compatibility. It logs key processing steps and error handling, while outputting converted JSON files in a specified directory. The modular design allows for easy customization and integration into larger GIS workflows.
