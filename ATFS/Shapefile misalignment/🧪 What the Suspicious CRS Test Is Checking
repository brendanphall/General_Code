🧪 What the Suspicious CRS Test Is Checking
🔍 The logic:
In your Python script, this line:

python
Copy
Edit
legacy_terms = ["Mercator_1SP", "Popular_Visualisation", "spherical"]
suspicious = any(term in crs_wkt for term in legacy_terms) if crs_wkt else False
is checking the CRS WKT string for any indication that the shapefile may have:


Term	Why It’s Suspicious
"Mercator_1SP"	Used in EPSG:3785 (deprecated “fake Mercator”) — spherical model
"Popular_Visualisation"	Legacy naming for 3785 from older Esri tools
"spherical"	Indicates the projection is based on a sphere instead of an ellipsoid — again, a sign of EPSG:3785
These are all markers of a projection that claims to be Web Mercator (EPSG:3857), but might actually be based on the older, less accurate EPSG:3785 definition.

🚩 Why This Matters
Just seeing epsg:3857 in .crs isn't enough!
A shapefile may declare itself as EPSG:3857 using:

json
Copy
Edit
"crs": { "init": "epsg:3857" }
But the .prj WKT inside the file might still follow the structure of EPSG:3785.

Many tools (like GeoTools) will use the WKT to determine how to reproject, not the EPSG code — especially if the WKT is ambiguous or non-authoritative.

This mismatch is what causes the ~12-mile northing shift (or other misalignment) in map display or geoprocessing.

✅ What crs_suspicious: true Means
“This shapefile says it’s using EPSG:3857, but its internal projection string contains signs that it might actually be using an outdated, spherical definition (EPSG:3785). Treat with caution — consider overriding or correcting the projection.”

Let me know if you'd like to expand this detection to match other patterns (like UTM zone mismatches, missing authorities, etc.), or if you want a visual of how these projection strings differ!
